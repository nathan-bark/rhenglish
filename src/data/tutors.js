  bio: `Hello! My name is Nathan, and I founded Robin Hood English to make learning fun and accessible. I have over 12 years of experience teaching English to students of all ages and levels.

I have a CELTA certificate from the University of Cambridge and I specialize in preparation for IELTS and Cambridge exams, as well as general English.

I believe that every student has a unique learning style, and my goal is to create a supportive environment where you can build confidence and achieve your English goals.

Outside of teaching I ride my bike around Bulgaria and read a lot of books.

I look forward to working with you!`,
