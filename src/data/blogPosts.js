      <p>Mastering pronunciation is a key part of speaking English fluently. Itâ€™s not just about sounding like a native speaker, but about being understood clearly. Here are five tips to help you on your journey:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-textPrimary text-lg mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Listen Actively:</strong> Pay close attention to how native speakers pronounce words, especially in podcasts, movies, and music. Don't just hear the words; listen to the rhythm and intonation.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Minimal Pairs:</strong> Minimal pairs are words that are different in only one sound, like "ship" and "sheep." Practicing these helps you differentiate between similar sounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Record Yourself:</strong> Use your phone to record your speech. This allows you to listen back and compare your pronunciation to that of a native speaker. It's one of the most effective ways to identify your problem areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Understand Phonetics:</strong> Learning the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) can be incredibly useful. It provides a consistent symbol for every sound, helping you pronounce words correctly even if you've never heard them before.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on Stress and Rhythm:</strong> English is a stress-timed language. The rhythm and stress you place on syllables and words are just as important as the individual sounds. Practice mimicking the rhythm of sentences you hear.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Consistency is key. Dedicate a few minutes each day to these practices, and you'll see a noticeable improvement in your clarity and confidence.</p>
